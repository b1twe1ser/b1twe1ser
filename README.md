### I'm Nico aka b1twe1ser  0️⃣🍺 



It's nice to meet you ! 🌟 

### Fun facts about me 🙆🏼‍♂️
I **love** dogs 🐶.  
Once upon a time I got a **_fullbody_** bruise,  
because I rode my new bike way to hard  
against a trash container 🗑.  
I didn't stop in time  because my mom told me: 
> When you face difficulty in life, just close your eyes and go through it !

_I love you mom ❤️_ It's not your fault, your son is a little off his game 🙈

### Who am I ? 🤷🏼‍♂️
- full time computer science student 📚
- fullstack mobile developer 📱
- flyfishing enthusiast 🎣
